In this repository you will find 3 examples we developped to get more familiar with Genetic Algorithms : 

- A little GA that found sequences of number that add up to make a result 

- A maze resolution Algorithm that resolve maze without having a metrics that indicate the distance of the player to the maze 

- A python implementation of the Eater Algorithm with visualisation
